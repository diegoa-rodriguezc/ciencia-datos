I enjoy winter skiing,  summer hiking , road trips or river trips, music, reading and favorite small children.  History, gardening, poetry and literature, food, agriculture are some of my interests.  Turkey, Greece, Ukraine, Mexico, Switzerland and France are places I've settled in for several weeks at a time.  In fact, staying in one place while exploring all around suits me better than continuous travel, and that's the experience I'd like to enable as a host.  Salem itself has much to offer besides options for scenic day trips: to the Pacific, to wineries of all sorts, cities north and south (Portland and Eugene), the Columbia Gorge and Mt Hood, waterfalls and forests, art galleries and museums.
One of my strengths is connecting folks with resources and opportunities.  At work, that's been my focus in helping newcomers with cultural adjustment.  Helping guests get the most from their time here appeals to me.  I also value independence and privacy, so knowing what guests prefer can make a good stay for us both.

Earl is a coffee perfectionist and our guests always get a fresh ground, fresh aero press cup of coffee as early as they need it.
Before moving to Texas in 1990 we lived in Homer, Alaska on the Kenai Peninsula for 20 years. Earl worked on the North Slope at Prudhoe Bay and was on the original crew that sent the first oil down the Alaska pipeline in 1978. 
Earl had always wanted to farm so off we went to Texas to raise beef cattle, soybeans and wheat. 
We love to travel and have enjoyed several road trips between Texas and Oregon! 
We love hosting and having the opportunity to meet so many different personalities and learn about different parts of our world and how we all fit together in it. We have the same attitude toward staying as guests. Airbnb is the perfect ambassador for our world.
